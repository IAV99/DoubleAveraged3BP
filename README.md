# Numerical solution of the three-body problem

## Considered:
* Planar three-body problem
* Masses of three bodies 𝑚_0, 𝑚_1 and 𝑚_2: 𝑚_1 + 𝑚_2 ≪ 𝑚_0
* Non-resonant case
* Eccentric anomaly averaging

## Result is calculated in the following Keplerian elements:
* e_1 - eccentricity of the inner planet
* e_2 - eccentricity of the outer planet
* ω_Δ = ω_1 - ω_2 - difference between arguments of periapsis
